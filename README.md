## Installations
The code is supposed to run using Python 3.x, Anaconda distribution should provide everything necessary to run the files successfully.

## Project Motivation
For the project, I was interestested in analysing AirBnb data to understand:

Where would it be ideal to be an AirBnb owner?
Are there any advantages in being a superhost in terms of occupancy?
What property characteristics are the most profitable?

## File Description
There is 1 notebook available here that shows every step of the analysis. The notebook is meant to show how the result of the analysis (here) was reached.
Datasets can be found on Kaggle ([Seattle](kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data#) and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston))

## Licensing, Authors and Acknowledgements
I am grateful to AirBnb and Kaggle for data availability.
