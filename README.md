## Installations
The code is supposed to run using Python 3.x, Anaconda distribution should provide everything necessary to run the files successfully.

## Project Motivation
For the project, I was interestested in analysing AirBnb data to understand:

1. Where would it be ideal to be an AirBnb owner? What are the best neighbourhoods?
2. Are there any advantages in being a superhost in terms of remuneration?
3. What are the main determinants of prices and occupancy?

## File Description
There is 1 notebook available here that shows every step of the analysis. The notebook is meant to show how the result of the analysis (here) was reached.
Datasets can be found on Kaggle ([Seattle](kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data#) and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston))

## Result
